# Blog-server
 This project is a Blog web which has been created to support the addition and removal of blogs from onto the site. It is a project that explores the server side of javascript and stores the information submitted by the user in clusters in mongoDB.
This project has been created to appreciate my love for Arsenal Football Club. Blogs related to their achievements, awards, records, history, and more.
Once a Gunner, Always a Gunner!
